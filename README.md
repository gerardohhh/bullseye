# Bullseye

**Bullseye** is an iOS app that helps users accomplish their goals. By allowing users to track their progress, receive inspiration and encouragement from fellow users, and be held accountable for progress, **Bullseye** intends to maintain the motivation users need to reach their dreams.

This app was built over a five-week period in collaboration with **Isabella Teng** and **Joshua Olumese** for *Facebook University Engineering* in July and August 2017.
